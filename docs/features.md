All the features of Bytes Browser in one place.

## Navigate, Edit, Optimize: All in One Place

### Advanced Navigation

BytesBrowser offers three intuitive ways to view your files: list, grid, and tree. Each option is designed to cater to different workflow preferences, letting you switch as your needs change. Our powerful Regex search functionality goes beyond file names, allowing you to scour file content, making it an ideal tool for developers.

### Real-time Editing and Command Execution

Imagine having the power of an IDE combined with the simplicity of a file explorer. With BytesBrowser, you can. The integrated terminal and basic code editor enable you to make quick edits, run scripts, or even perform batch operations without leaving your workspace.

### AI-Powered Performance Optimization

What makes BytesBrowser revolutionary is its use of machine learning algorithms for optimization. The Smart Optimizer reviews your system to recommend files for deletion or archiving, ensuring optimal system performance. The background cacher indexes your file system in the background, cutting down future search times drastically. 

## Beyond File Management: Your Development Control Center

### Git Integration

Forget about switching to a separate Git client for version control. BytesBrowser incorporates Git features, making branching, committing, and pulling easier than ever.

### Custom Commands and Hot Keys

Customize your experience down to the finest details. With BytesBrowser, you can create custom commands to perform specific tasks or batch operations. Hot keys can be assigned for frequent actions, making your workflow even faster.

### Extensibility and Collaboration

BytesBrowserâ€™s architecture is built to be extended. You can integrate it with third-party tools like Docker, GitHub, and Jira, making it incredibly versatile. Plus, QR code-based file sharing and cloud sync options enable effortless collaboration among team members.

### Cloud

Host files on Bytes Cloud right from the app from any connected device. More information on cloud will be released soon.

## Performance And Metrics

### App Performance

BytesBrowser is built with speed as one of the primary concerns of the development process. Making sure every line of code is checked, tested, and performant is the baseline of quality for the development team.

In testing, we monitored how long it took both Windows and macOS systems to search and navigate directories. In some cases having 2 1TB drives my searches can take up to 3 minutes on a Windows machine! Meanwhile, BytesBrowser uses an efficient tokenization system to return most searches in a few seconds.

### System Usage

BytesBrowser is built for most systems, even those who are just happy with their budget computer. Tauri allows us to use Rust on the backend, making operations much faster and RAM usage relatively low sitting around 1.2Gb.
